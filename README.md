<h2>Why ReactJS? </h2>
<p>The main reason why I built this in ReactJS was to challenge myself to learn a new front-end framework. I specifically chose ReactJS mainly beause I like the 
idea of being able to reuse components; not only can you reuse components, but you also use a dynamic markup. Using a dynamic markup (JSX) allows each component to have its own "state".
